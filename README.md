Our site SkyView is for people interested in the solar system, regardless of level of expertise, with information on the planets with a feed of posts on each, there is plenty to see. Users who choose not to login can still benefit by simply browsing the site content and reading, however making an account offers users the ability to interact with posts with likes, comments or even posts of their own. The siteâ€™s feed being created by the users allow a community to discuss all the new developments from space exploration to stars and galaxies.
